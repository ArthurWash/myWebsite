This is my personal website to promote my skills in Web Development, Video Production, and Audio Production.

This includes:
1. A home page which provides a general overview
2. A video portfolio page
3. An audio portfolio page
4. A web development page
5. An about me page
6. A contact page

This has been an interesting project, as I started this website back when I was fresh out of an HTML/CSS foundation course. The differences are very apparent between V1 and V2. In V2 (current version). I'm proud with how this came out!
